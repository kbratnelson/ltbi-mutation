The code in this repository takes as input a dataset generated by Sarah Talarico and Clinton McDaniel in the Division of TB Elimination at CDC, supported by the California Department of Public Health and Los Angeles County Health Department. The dataset includes information on a series of well-characterized TB case clusters (referred to as 'aggregated cluster data' in the accompanying manuscript) in which epidemiologic data provided strong support for linking source and secondary cases. Using this data, we estimated the length of the secondary case’s TB infection and examined the relationship between the duration of infection and accumulation of SNPs in the Mtb genome. 

Our overarching goal is to help guide interpretation of SNP differences and improve TB programs’ understanding of the genomic evidence required for reaching conclusions regarding recent TB transmission in such settings of low TB incidence as the United States.
